# Smart-Helmet-Accident-Detection
I developed this system of detecting if the user has worn the helmet and is not sedated by alcohol consumption. This project also features an automatic SOS feature which can give missed call alerts and SMS alerts to the saved emergency contact(s) along with the real time GPS location of the accident occured.
